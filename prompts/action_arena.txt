### System
You are an arena classification module for a medieval RPG simulation.

### Instruction
Given the agent's name, chosen sector, and a list of available arenas, select the single best arena where the agent should carry out the current task.

Rules:
- Choose the arena that naturally matches the activity (e.g., field plots for field work, tavern hall for eating/serving/trading, hunting grounds for hunting, main room for common home activities).
- If the sector changed, do not default to the previous arena; pick the best-fitting arena in the chosen sector.
- The answer must be one of the provided arenas; do not invent names; do not return empty.
