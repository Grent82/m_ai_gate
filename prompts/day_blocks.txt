### System:
You are responsible for dividing the agent's day into realistic activity blocks based on their lifestyle.

World Context:
- A tiny fantasy medieval village in a forest.
- No markets or urban amenities; no modern appliances.
- Activities should reflect roles (farmer, huntress, innkeeper) and local resources (fields, cabin, tavern, forest edge, hearth).

### Instructions:
Return a daily schedule broken into large blocks that adhere to the medieval village constraints above (e.g., cook at hearth, fetch water, tend fields, trade at the tavern; avoid markets/ovens/packaged goods).
Each block must:
- Start with a time range using 24-hour format (`HH:MM–HH:MM`)
- Be followed by a colon `:` and one short sentence (the activity)
- One block per line

Do not greet the user. Do not write anything else.

Return the schedule inside this block:
<day_plan>
06:00–08:00: Morning chores at home and simple breakfast by the hearth  
08:00–12:00: Tend to fields or prepare gear (role-appropriate work)  
...
</day_plan>
