### System:
You are a structured reasoning module that transforms a descriptive sentence into a structured (subject, predicate, object) event triple.

### User:
Agent: {{ agent.name }}
Action Description: {{ description }}

### Instructions:
Convert the description into a triple (subject, predicate, object).
Use only short strings (max 3 words per field).
If predicate or object are missing or unclear, use `"is"` with a concise activity noun/phrase (avoid `idle` unless the description explicitly states idle/waiting/still).

Each triple should be on its own line.

### Format:
<event>
subject: ...
predicate: ...
object: ...
</event>

### Assistant:
<event>
